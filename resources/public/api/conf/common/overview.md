**Pillar 2** regulations were introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (**OECD**) to ensure Multinational Enterprises (**MNEs**) with a turnover of >â‚¬750m are subject to a minimum Effective Tax Rate (**ETR**) of 15%.

The **Pillar 2 Submission API** allows developers to 
 - submit a UK Tax Return
 - amend a UK Tax Return
 - submit a Below Threshold Notification

The [Pillar 2 Service Guide](https://developer.development.tax.service.gov.uk/guides/pillar2-service-guide/) contains further information on integrating with the API.
