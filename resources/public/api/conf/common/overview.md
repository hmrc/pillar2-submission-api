*Pillar 2* charging mechanisms were introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (**OECD**) to ensure Multinational Enterprises (**MNEs**) with a turnover of â‚¬750m or more are subject to a minimum Effective Tax Rate (**ETR**) of 15%.

The *Pillar 2 API* allows developers to 
 - submit a UK Tax Return (**UKTR**)
 - amend a UK Tax Return
 - submit a Below-Threshold Notification (**BTN**)
 - return obligation and submission details for a specified accounting period
 - submit an Overseas Return Notification (**ORN**)
 - amend a submitted ORN
 - retrieve the details of a submitted ORN


The [Pillar 2 Service Guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/pillar2-service-guide) contains further information on integrating with the API, including a glossary of terms and acronyms relating to the Pillar 2 API. The [Pillar 2 Roadmap](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/roadmaps/pillar2-roadmap/) contains information on the Pillar 2 API release schedule.
