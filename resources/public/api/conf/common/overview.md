*Pillar 2* regulations were introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (**OECD**) to ensure Multinational Enterprises (**MNEs**) with a turnover of â‚¬750m or more are subject to a minimum Effective Tax Rate (**ETR**) of 15%.

The Pillar 2 API allows developers to 
 - submit a UK Tax Return
 - amend a UK Tax Return
 - submit a Below-Threshold Notification

The Pillar 2 Service Guide contains further information on integrating with the API, including a glossary of terms and acronyms relating to the Pillar 2 API.
