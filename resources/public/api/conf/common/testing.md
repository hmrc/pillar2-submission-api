API testing is performed in the [HMRC developer hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) sandbox environment. Once youâ€™ve registered for an account you can conduct your own testing. The Pillar 2 API belongs to the *Corporation Tax* category.

To start, use the developer hub to create an application in the test environment (sandbox), then locate and subscribe to the API.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact our [support team](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support).
