API testing is hosted in the [HMRC developer hub](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation). Once youâ€™ve registered for an account you can conduct your own testing.

The [getting started](https://developer.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub) section of the developer hub contains instructions and tutorials to help you work with our APIs.

- [Creating an application](https://developer.tax.service.gov.uk/developer/applications/) in our test environment (sandbox).
- Locate the landing page for the [Pillar 2 Submission API](https://developer.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/pillar2-submission-api/1.0).
- Start working with the APIs, using the [getting started](https://developer.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub) section as a point of reference.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact our [support team](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support).
