You can use the sandbox environment to <link:test this API>. You can use the <link:Create Test User API> or its frontend service to create test users.

It may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the Gov-Test-Scenario header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a ‘Test data’ section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the Gov-Test-Scenario header.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <Link:our support team>.
